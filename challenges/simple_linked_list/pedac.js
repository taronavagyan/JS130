// Write a simple linked list implementation. The linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science, often used in the implementation of other data structures.

// The simplest kind of linked list is a singly linked list. Each element in the list contains data and a "next" field pointing to the next element in the list of elements. This variant of linked lists is often used to represent sequences or push-down stacks (also called a LIFO stack; Last In, First Out).

// Let's create a singly linked list whose elements may contain a range of data such as the numbers 1-10. Provide functions to reverse the linked list and convert a linked list to and from an array.
