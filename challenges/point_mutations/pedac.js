// Write a program that can calculate the Hamming distance between two DNA strands.

// The Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length.  If you have two sequences of unequal length, you should compute the Hamming distance over the shorter length.

// Hamming distance is difference between two strands, char by char

// E

// GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT
// CATCGTAATGACGGCCT
// ^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^

// Hamming distance of 7

// D

// Strings, arrays

// A

// given two strands, take the length of the shorter strand
// set hammingDistance to 0
// loop through chars of both strands
// if the chars are different, increment hammingDistance by 1
// return hammingDistance

// C

// see dna.js
