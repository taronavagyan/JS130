// Write a program that conforms to the above requirements and encrypts text strings with the following simple (and very unsecure) cipher:

// Replace each letter in the original string with another letter.
// The first letter of the alphabet should be replaced with the last.
// The second letter of the alphabet should be replaced with the next to last.
// The third letter of the alphabet should be replace with the second from the last.
// Continue on in this manner throughout the alphabet.
// For example, the word money gets encrypted as nlmvb.
