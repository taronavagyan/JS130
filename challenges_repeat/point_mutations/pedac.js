// Write a program that can calculate the Hamming distance between two DNA strands.

// Find differences in 2 strings

// The Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length. If you have two sequences of unequal length, you should compute the Hamming distance over the shorter length.

// The Hamming distance between these two DNA strands is 7.

// D

// dna class
// constructor takes string
// hammingDistance instance method (takes string), return num
